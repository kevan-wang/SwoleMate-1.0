    "Supplement:  ZMA (a blend of zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6) may help with vitamin deficiencies, but its effectiveness with muscle gains is unclear.  If you choose to use it, take it on right before bed.",
    "Supplement:  Melatonin is a safe, natural sleep aid that helps synchronize your sleep cycles and provides deeper, more restful sleep!  Take it about half an hour before bed!",
    "Supplement:  BCAAs (Branched Chain Amino Acids) aid in muscle recovery and help prevent muscle breakdown!  Take about 3-5 mg both before and after your workout!",
    "Supplement:  Creatine phosphate helps improve power, stamina, and recovery!  Try 5 grams a day dissolved in your morning tea or coffee!",
    "Supplement:  Whey protein is an essential for muscle building, since it is rapidly absorbed and speeds muscle recovery!  Take a scoop dissolved in water ASAP after your workout!",
    "Supplements like Creatine Phosphate and BCAAs don't dissolve easily in cold water.  Either mix them into hot drinks or buy them in capsule form!",
    "Form:  Remember that good form is crucial!  Lowering the weights to get good form is always better than pumping heavy with bad form!",
    "Form:  Never lock your joints!  Not only does this interrupt the Time Under Tension for your muscles, it places strain on your joints which can cause injury!",
    "Form:  Let the weights come to a rest as little as possible between reps.  You'll want to keep your muscles under constant tension throughout a set!",
    "Form:  Your muscle gets more of a workout with a gradual release on the eccentric portion of your rep.  That is, when you're releasing the weight back down to its starting position.  Let the weights down slowly as you finish for better gains!",
    "Fitness is about nutrition and recovery every bit as much as it's about exercise!  Remember to eat healthy and sleep well!",
    "There is such a thing as too much protein!  Excess protein can't be absorbed by the human body and is excreted instead.  Taking more than 15 grams of whey protein every 90 minutes is just wasteful!",
    "Not all whey protein brands are the same!  A lot are made with cheap filler materials or low quality protein.  A little research will help keep you from getting fooled!",
    "While traditionally we were taught to stretch before exercising, static stretching actually decreases performance and increases risk of injury!  Do light warmup exercises or dynamic stretches instead!",
    "As nice as it would be to relax with a brew after a workout, even small amounts of alcohol has been shown to inhibit protein synthesis and hurts your muscle recovery.  Stay away from the booze if you wanna keep your gains!",
    "Your Swolemate respects people of all shapes and sizes!  Plus-size weightlifters or slim runners are just as legit as your stereotypical gym bunny.  So long as you're happy and healthy, Swolemate is here to support you!",
    "Marathon runners with intense regimens can suffer from cardiac fibrosis, where healthy heart tissue is replaced with unhealthy scar tissue.  For this reason, SwoleMate recommends modest High Intensity Interval Training when doing cardio, which avoids this problem!",
    "REMINDER:  Be sure to update your profile on the reg, preferably once a week to account for changes in age, height, or weight!"

    "Standard sets (AKA straight sets) use a standard number of reps for each set.  Useful in a wide variety of applications from strength training to endurance to general fitness.",
    "Pyramid sets start off light/high-rep and increase the weight while decreasing the number of reps with each progressive set.  Warm-up sets are built in to ease you into it!",
    "Reverse Pyramid sets start off heavy/low-rep and decrease the weight while increasing the rep count with each set.  Cool-down sets are built-in which help with muscle recovery!"
